Programming Project 1


For P4.2 I just took a straight sequential approach, executing Gaussâ€™ algorithm step by step.

For P4.8 I utilized both division and modulus operations to deduce the optimal amount of each monetary denomination given by the cash register as change to the customer.

Note:
Neither of these programs contain elaborate safeguards against malicious or even irregular user input. In P4.8, if the user inputs amounts using decimal numbers as apposed to penny integers, the program will crash.
