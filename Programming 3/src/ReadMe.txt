The credit card class is designed with three main instance variables to hold the primary information of the credit card number, validity, and errorCode if any error during the Checking process were to occur.

In addition, the class contains instance variables for the numerical value of all card number digits relevant to the Checking process.

Utilizing the concept of functions, each of the 6 steps in the Checking algorithm is contained within their own function that is then called in succession during the check function().

The other functions that exist simply access the information stored in given instance variables.

Note:
The class is designed to work with designated tester method. The class constructor and other methods are not designed to handle malicious input and are specifically tailored to the instructions of the assignment
